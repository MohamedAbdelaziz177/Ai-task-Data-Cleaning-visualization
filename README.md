# Car Dataset: Data Cleaning and Visualization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and visualizing a dataset of cars to derive meaningful insights. By leveraging the power of Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**, the project aims to preprocess raw data, handle missing values, and visualize trends and relationships effectively.

---

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handle missing and inconsistent values.
  - Remove or impute outliers.
  - Normalize and standardize numerical data.
  - Encode categorical variables (if any).

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Analyze relationships between features such as **price**, **mileage (KM)**, and **car age**.
  - Visualize distributions and trends.
  - Plot correlations to identify key driving factors.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
  - **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Specify the dataset source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Repository, or self-curated].
- **Features**:
  - `Brand`: Car brand name (e.g., Toyota, Honda).
  - `Model`: Specific car model.
  - `Year`: Year of manufacture.
  - `Mileage (KM)`: Distance the car has been driven.
  - `Price (USD)`: Selling price of the car.
  - `Fuel Type`: (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Electric).
  - `Transmission`: (e.g., Manual, Automatic).

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Load the car dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Remove duplicates and handle missing values.
   - Identify and treat outliers using statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR).
   - Standardize numerical columns like `Mileage` and `Price`.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Generate descriptive statistics.
   - Visualize distributions of key features (e.g., histogram of car prices).
   - Analyze relationships using scatter plots (e.g., KM vs Price).

4. **Visualization**:
   - Box plots to identify outliers.
   - Line plots for trend analysis over time.
   - Heatmaps for correlation matrices.
